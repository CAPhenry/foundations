# hmp-blips

`hmp-blips` is Foundation's authoritative registry for Hogwarts Legacy map, minimap, HUD-compass,
search-area, and remote-player markers. Gameplay resources register intent on the server; this
resource owns the shared native `Blips` keyspace, resolves audiences, and keeps every client converged.

It replaces the mod repository's production `blips` resource. Do not migrate or load `blips-dev` on
a production server; its style probes and internal dumps remain development tooling.

## World markers and search circles

Declare `hmp-blips`, then upsert a marker with an owning resource and stable id:

```ts
import type { HmpBlipsServer } from "../../hmp-blips/types";

const Blips = Imports.get<HmpBlipsServer<Player>>("hmp-blips");

await Blips.markers.upsert({
    resource: "hmp-shops",
    id: "ollivanders",
    kind: "marker",
    position: { x, y, z },
    icon: "UI_T_MiniMap_Waypoint",
    label: "Ollivanders",
    ttl: 0,
    areaId: "Hogsmeade",
});
```

The native key becomes `hmp:<resource>:<id>`, so two resources may use the same local id without
colliding. Upserting the same resource/id moves or restyles the existing marker and restarts its TTL.
Only its owner can remove it:

```ts
Blips.markers.remove("ollivanders", "hmp-shops");
```

When the owning resource stops, all of its markers and player groups are removed automatically.

Search circles use the same API. Their radius is in **metres**; world positions remain centimetres:

```ts
await Blips.markers.upsert({
    resource: "hmp-dispatch",
    id: `trace:${caseId}`,
    kind: "circle",
    position: lastKnownPosition,
    radius: 120,
    ttl: 300,
    audience: { groups: [{ key: "job:auror" }] },
    areaId: lastKnownArea,
});

Blips.markers.pulse(`trace:${caseId}`, "hmp-dispatch");
```

Markers support `icon`, `label`, `showOnHud`, and `showDistance`. An icon must name a safe native
compass style; the Framework rejects types without a `UI_DT_CompassStyles` row because the game
otherwise dereferences a missing style and crashes.

## TTL and replay

TTL is measured in seconds. Omitting it uses `defaultTtl` (600 seconds by default), while zero requests
a permanent marker. `maxTtl` can clamp every request—including permanence—to a hard ceiling.

Expiry occurs on the server and issues an ordinary removal. A late joiner receives only currently
live markers they are allowed to see. TTL is a leak backstop, not the primary lifecycle: remove a
marker as soon as the owning event ends.

## Audiences

An omitted audience means every connected player. Audiences may also be player/id iterables, resolver
functions, or declarative selectors:

```ts
audience: {
    groups: [
        { key: "job:auror", minimumGrade: 1 },
        { key: "dispatch" },
    ],
    groupMode: "any",
    areaId: "Hogwarts",
    regionId: "SouthWing",
    virtualWorld: 0,
    where: async (player) => isOnDuty(player),
}
```

Group requirements use hmp-core's effective account/character groups, including groups projected by
hmp-jobs. Resolvers and predicates are evaluated again for updates and replay. If a resolver,
predicate, or group lookup throws, it resolves to nobody—scoped markers never fail open.

Top-level `areaId`, `regionId`, and `virtualWorld` scope the marker itself. This is recommended for
every coordinate-based marker: identical numbers do not identify the same place across game areas.
`playerLocationChanged`, `hmp:groups:changed`, and `hmp:jobs:duty` automatically refresh audiences.
Call `markers.sync()` after another application-specific resolver changes.

## Player tracking groups

Player groups independently define subjects (whose icons exist) and audience (who sees them):

```ts
await Blips.players.track({
    resource: "hmp-jobs",
    id: "on-duty-aurors",
    subjects: {
        groups: [{ key: "job:auror" }],
        where: (player) => Jobs.duty.isOnDuty(player, "auror"),
    },
    audience: { groups: [{ key: "job:auror" }] },
    color: [0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0],
    priority: 20,
    sameArea: true,
    sameVirtualWorld: true,
});
```

Presence is the union of every matching group. Color is selected separately from the highest-priority
group that supplies one, so a colorless party group can add someone without removing their Auror
color. Equal priorities keep the earlier incumbent.

`sameArea`, `sameRegion`, and `sameVirtualWorld` compare each subject with each viewer. A subject is
never shown to themselves.

With `showAllPlayers: true` (the compatibility default), native remote-player blips remain visible and
groups only recolor them. Set it to false for the GTA-RP shape where only registered party/job groups
appear. This hides an icon, not network state; it is not a stealth or security mechanism.

Call `players.refresh()` when a custom subject/audience predicate changes. Connect, disconnect,
location, hmp-core group, and hmp-jobs duty changes refresh automatically.

## Configuration

Copy `examples/config/data/hmp-blips.json` into the server's `data` directory. It controls:

- `defaultTtl`, `maxTtl`, and `maxMarkersPerResource`;
- `showAllPlayers`, `houseTint`, `playerBlipScale`, and `hideBaseIcon`;
- `enableCommands` and `command` for the private closed-test command.

Environment overrides are `HMP_BLIPS_CONFIG`, `HMP_BLIPS_DEFAULT_TTL`, `HMP_BLIPS_MAX_TTL`,
`HMP_BLIPS_MAX_MARKERS`, `HMP_BLIPS_SHOW_ALL`, `HMP_BLIPS_HOUSE_TINT`,
`HMP_BLIPS_PLAYER_SCALE`, `HMP_BLIPS_HIDE_BASE`, `HMP_BLIPS_COMMANDS`, and `HMP_BLIPS_COMMAND`.

## Closed-test commands

The bundled command only creates private markers at the caller's current location:

```text
/blips status
/blips list
/blips marker [ttl]
/blips circle [radiusMetres] [ttl]
/blips pulse
/blips remove
```

Style dumps, memory probes, global recoloring, and other `blips-dev` commands are deliberately absent.

## Client ownership

The client bundle is intentionally a mirror rather than a public write API. It applies full replay,
incremental set/remove, pulse, player visibility, and color messages to the native `Blips` builtin.
On shutdown it clears script markers and restores normal all-player tracking, house tint, scale, and
base-icon visibility so hot reload cannot strand stale UI state.
