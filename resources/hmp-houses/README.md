# hmp-houses

`hmp-houses` is Foundations's character-scoped Hogwarts house and House Cup service. It keeps durable
membership and point history in MySQL, projects membership into `hmp-core` groups, and applies the
selected character's house through the mod's native `player.house` property.

## Membership

```ts
const Houses = Imports.get("hmp-houses");

await Houses.membership.set(player, "gryffindor", {
    resource: "hmp-sorting",
    actor: player,
    reason: "Sorting ceremony",
});

const membership = await Houses.membership.get(player);
await Houses.membership.clear(player, {
    resource: "hmp-admin",
    actor: administrator,
    reason: "Correcting an invalid assignment",
});
```

Membership belongs to the active character, not the account or network player. On character load the
service:

1. reads the authoritative `hmp_house_memberships` row;
2. maintains exactly one projected group such as `house:gryffindor`;
3. assigns native `player.house`, causing Hogwarts Legacy to rebuild house-aware robes and crests.

A character without an assignment is synchronized as native `Unaffiliated`, preventing one character's
house from leaking across a character switch. Clearing membership removes every Foundations-owned
`house:*` projection. Other resources should normally check `hmp-core` groups rather than importing
this resource just for access control.

Every actual transition is written to `hmp_house_membership_audit`. Reassigning the same house is an
idempotent no-op and does not manufacture another audit row.

## House Cup points

Every consequential caller supplies a stable reference:

```ts
const transaction = await Houses.points.award("gryffindor", 25, {
    reference: `quidditch:${match.id}:winner:gryffindor`,
    resource: "hmp-quidditch",
    actor: referee,
    reason: "Won the fixture",
    metadata: { matchId: match.id },
});
```

`award` accepts a positive amount, `deduct` accepts a positive amount and records it as negative, and
`adjust` accepts an explicitly signed amount. The reference is globally unique. Repeating the same
operation returns its completed transaction without changing the standing twice; reusing the reference
for a different house, amount, actor, or resource is rejected.

The ledger records a pending row before applying its standing update. Applying the balance and completing
the transaction occur in one MySQL transaction. A process interruption between those phases leaves a
visible pending row that `points.recover(reference)` can safely finish. Rejected operations are marked
failed rather than remaining capable of applying unexpectedly later.

```ts
await Houses.points.standings();
await Houses.points.get("ravenclaw");
await Houses.points.history("ravenclaw", 50);
await Houses.points.pending(50);
```

`allowNegativePoints` controls whether deductions may take a house below zero. JavaScript safe-integer
limits are enforced even though MySQL can store larger values.

## Events

- `hmp:houses:changed` follows a successful membership transition and includes the online player when
  available, active character, new membership, and previous house.
- `hmp:houses:points` follows a newly completed or recovered point transaction and includes the updated
  standing.
- Projected membership also produces the ordinary `hmp:groups:changed` events from `hmp-core`.

## Exports

- `membership.get/set/clear/members/history/sync`
- `points.get/standings/adjust/award/deduct/transaction/history/pending/recover`
- `status`

## Closed-testing commands

Everyone may inspect their assignment and current standings:

```text
/house
/house <me|nick|#id>
/points
/points history [house|all] [limit]
```

Members of a configured `adminGroups` entry may mutate them:

```text
/house <me|nick|#id> <gryffindor|hufflepuff|ravenclaw|slytherin|clear>
/points <house> <signedAmount> [reference]
/points recover <reference>
```

The optional reference on the command is useful for intentionally replaying the same closed-test
operation. Production gameplay resources should always construct a deterministic reference from their
own event or match ID.

Sorting ceremonies, house-specific missions, Quidditch rules, dormitory gender, and bespoke House Cup
presentation are intentionally outside this resource. They consume its APIs and projected groups.
