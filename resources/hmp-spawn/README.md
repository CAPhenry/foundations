# hmp-spawn

`hmp-spawn` completes the Foundations login path: account → character → world. After
`hmp-characters` selects a character, this resource offers configured destinations and that
character's last saved position, then performs a server-issued streamed teleport.

The streamed teleport is the HogwartsMP Framework's supported path. It roots destination streaming,
waits until the area is ready, optionally performs capsule-aware ground placement, moves the pawn,
and reports a structured completion through `playerTeleportComplete`. The resource accepts success
only with the client-observed final transform and saves that landing point rather than the requested
coordinates. The client keeps controls locked and the screen faded until that success arrives;
failed or timed-out destinations return the player to selection.

## Persistence

Last location is stored in `hmp-core` character metadata under `hmp-spawn:last-location`. It is saved:

- after a successful spawn,
- periodically while the character is in the world,
- before character unload or disconnect.

A character that has not completed spawning cannot overwrite its saved position with a staging or
selection-screen location.

## Configuration

Optional `data/hmp-spawn.json`:

```json
{
  "showSelector": true,
  "allowLastLocation": true,
  "saveLastLocation": true,
  "defaultLocation": "hogwarts",
  "teleportTimeoutMs": 120000,
  "autoSaveMs": 60000,
  "locations": [
    {
      "key": "hogwarts",
      "label": "Hogwarts",
      "description": "Return to the castle grounds.",
      "areaId": "Hogwarts",
      "x": 366784,
      "y": -461527,
      "z": -82610,
      "yaw": 90,
      "snapToGround": true,
      "groundSnapDistance": 2000
    }
  ]
}
```

Environment overrides: `HMP_SPAWN_CONFIG`, `HMP_SPAWN_SELECTOR`,
`HMP_SPAWN_LAST_LOCATION`, `HMP_SPAWN_SAVE_LOCATION`, and `HMP_SPAWN_DEFAULT`.

If `showSelector` is false, the character spawns at their last location when available and otherwise
at `defaultLocation`.

Set `areaId` (and optionally `regionId`) on configured destinations. Scoped destinations are shown
only while the player is in that game-authored coordinate space. Saved locations retain this context
and are not offered as same-area teleports from a different map. During world travel,
`playerLocationChanged` supplies the last valid snapshot before location becomes unavailable.

## Exports

```js
const Spawn = Imports.get("hmp-spawn");

const remove = Spawn.locations.register({
    key: "ministry",
    label: "Ministry of Magic",
    description: "For Ministry staff.",
    x: 100,
    y: 200,
    z: 300,
    resource: "hmp-ministry",
});

await Spawn.ui.open(player);
await Spawn.spawn(player, "ministry");
```

Registered locations are automatically removed when their owning resource stops. Built-in configured
locations cannot be removed at runtime.

## Lifecycle events

- `hmp:spawn:started` — `{ session, character, location, requestId }`
- `hmp:spawn:complete` — `{ session, character, location, completion }`; `location` contains the observed landing transform
- `hmp:spawn:failed` — `{ session, character, location, status, message }`

Framework teleport status `0` is success. Other statuses represent superseded, unavailable,
world-changed or teleport-failed requests; `hmp-spawn` uses status `6` for its own timeout.
